Global United Hockey - Retro Expansion (EHM retro Database)
Global United Hockey Retro-eX EHM database
My beta version of the a retro-EHM database. 

I am still adding a lot, but the initial version should be playable. 

Over 2000 NHL players that have played between 1972 to 2024 that have played at least 1 NHL game. 

Various International players that did not crossover, that could have been NHL players have been given random based PA ratings based on estimated NHL contribution. 
 
I did add several thousand < 100 PA rated playersto fill out junior drafts and CHL leagues.

ALL 16 1972-73 NHL teams, ALL 12 WHA teams*, 2 future expansions added early to fill out 30 teams into a unified single Nationalternative Hockey League

Fictional or modified inclusions: <br />
1972 Soviet Union Olympic team -> Washington Capitals <br />
1972 Czechoslovakia Olympic team -> Indianapolis Racers

NHL Changes. to avoid similar color branding or geographical locations I have made the executive decision to do the following WHA team relocations:
<br />
Philadelphia Blazers have relocated as the Calgary Cowboys, a future WHA expansion that was not present in 1972 <br />
Chicago Cougars relocated as the Colorado Cougars, to avoid 2 Chicago teams and shifting the color scheme to the modern Colorado Avalanche  <br />
New York Raiders relocated as the Jersey Devils, the real life Raiders shifted around a bit, partially ending up in New Jersey, with the league missing the popular Devils franchise, I rebranded a mix of the 1980's Devils with the EHL Devils minor league team  <br />
Minnesota Fighting Saints relocating as the Miami Screaming Eagles. Miami was an original WHA team that folded before they got off the ground, and I rebranded them using the modern Florida Panthers color scheme <br />
Ottawa Nationals rebranding as the Ottawa Toros, the Nationals ended up moving to Toronto and Birmingham, and I liked the Bull team name. The color scheme was a very common red/white/blue, so I rebranded using the modern Ottawa Senators colors and used the Toros name. <br />
Los Angeles Sharks relocated as the Seattle Sharks. Since the California Golden Seals use the modern San Jose area as their home base, I decided to just shift the team further north, using a mix of the modern SJ Sharks and Seattle Kraken color schemes.  <br />
The WHL, QMJHL, and OHL have each been expanded to 30 teams (90 junior teams) to encourage star junior players to get more ice team and spread talent. This may not stay in the final release, but I thought it was neat if anyone wanted to try to work from the ground up.  <br />
The whole NCAA and Canadien U-Sport system has been combined into a single NCAA retro league with promotion and relegation between Divisions 1-3. Similar to the junior system, there are a lot of teams, for GMs that like to work their way up the chain. Can provide a neat playstyle for solo or even online teams.  <br /> <br />

A few shout outs to ECK for his work with pivot and overall greatness in the community, most of this stuff wouldn't be possible without his contribution.

A few disclaimers : <br />
World Championship tournaments to include all modern IIHF countries.  <br />
I decided to keep Modern country scheme for a few reasons to avoid any underlying code issues related to country codes, as well as avoid any politcal statements in any directions.  <br />
Combined divisional tournaments WC 1 - 4 A & B into single division tournaments to allow more countries in each tournament <br />

Looking for feedback and other testing issues: <br />
Player types wildly incorrect  <br />
Any gameplay issues  <br />
Salary cap was fairly arbitrarily set and is being tweaked at 71.4M; I am still playing around with this number, but if you have any feedback please let me know.  <br /> <br />


To do: <br />
Finish tweaking modifying ratings. All star players (170+ playing up to 2020 to have more hardcoded PA ratings, while letting more modern stars to have have a more random path. <br />
Tweak drafts to allow more randomness of under non-180+ players random ranges <br />
Redo the bantom/AAAA/international leagues. <br />

Looking to finish logo pack and player pack in the future.
